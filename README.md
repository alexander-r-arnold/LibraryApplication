<h3>LibraryApplication</h3>

<p>This is a library application containing the books I have read recently. This is building to gain experience using MongoDB, Express, Node, and Gulp.</p>

<p>There was a lot of copy &amp; pasting done with the views, but that was not the primary purpose of this application. The primary purpose was to learn and understand how mongodb interacts with node and express and also how to use gulp to help manage your application.</p>

<p>Assuming npm, node, and mongodb are installed, here are the steps to run this program</p>
<ol>
	<li>npm install all the dependent packages accordingly</li>
	<li>run the mongod service (make sure the /data/db directory exists</li>
	<li>run 'npm start' or 'gulp serve'</li>
	<li>if this is your first time running the program, go to /admin/addbooks in the url to add the data necessary to the database.</li>
</ol>
